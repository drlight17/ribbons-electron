### üìÇ How to install?
1. Choose you platform distrib.
2. Click download.
3. Follow installation.


## Supported settings
All app settings are saved in the local user folder in file config.json:
- Windows 7 and newer: `%AppData%\Ribbons screensaver`
- Linux `~/.config/Ribbons screensaver`

## Usage
This app is created to be used as screensaver with idle system detect to run fullscreen animation. For current alpha version it isn't supposed to be:
- "native" windows scr app as there are no native winapi preview and settings implementation
- "native" linux xscreensaver app as there are no plans to develop something for xscreensaver api

### <ins>So for both platforms make sure to disable "native" screensaver to prevent conflicts!</ins>

After app startup check it's settings in tray menu:

## For developers
Build depends on the platform as it uses the system idle detect function.

For Windows:
```
choco install python312 visualstudio2019community visualstudio2019-workload-nativedesktop visualstudio2019buildtools windows-sdk-10.0
pip install setuptools
git clone https://github.com/drlight17/ribbons-electron
cd ./ribbons-electron
cp ./package.json.windows ./package.json
```
For Linux:
```
apt install libxss-dev pkg-config
git clone https://github.com/drlight17/ribbons-electron
cd ./ribbons-electron
cp ./package.json.linux ./package.json
```
Platform independent steps:
```
npm install -g node-gyp
npm install --save-dev electron-rebuild
npx electron-rebuild
```
To run dev app use:
```
npm start 
```
In dev mode config path includes '-dev'

To build distributive use:
```
npm run dist
```
If there are any module errors try to `npx electron-rebuild` before every `npm start` or `npm run dist`.

Also check [package.json.linux](package.json.linux) and [package.json.windows](package.json.windows)
